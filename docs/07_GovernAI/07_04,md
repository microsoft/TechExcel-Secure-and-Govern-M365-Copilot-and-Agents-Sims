### Congratulations

You’ve completed the workshop—great work!

Over the last exercises, you:
- Assessed your organization’s sensitive data and existing **sensitivity labels**.
- Scoped **Copilot** access safely using **Restricted Search Scope** and site-level controls.
- Turned on **Audit** and activated targeted **DSPM for AI** policies to surface real risk.
- Protected sensitive content with **DLP** actions that prevent Copilot from processing high-risk data.
- Implemented **dynamic protections** with Insider Risk signals and label-driven controls.
- Established lifecycle governance with **Data Lifecycle Management**, **Audit**, **eDiscovery**, and a **Compliance Manager** assessment.


**What’s next**
- [] Review **Activity Explorer** and **DSPM for AI** reports weekly to validate policy impact.  
- [] Fine-tune **labels**, **auto-labeling**, and **DLP** based on real findings.  
- [] Bind **authentication contexts** to the labels that guard your most critical sites.  
- [] Formalize a **retention** standard for Copilot interactions across apps and agents.  
- [] Track progress in **Compliance Manager** and close improvement actions.

Thanks for completing the workshop. You now have a practical, defensible approach to securing AI use—from discovery and protection to monitoring and compliance.
