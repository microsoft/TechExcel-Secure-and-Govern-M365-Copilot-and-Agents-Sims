## Task 04: Enable SharePoint restricted search scope (RSS)

### Description
Enable RSS so Copilot and SharePoint search only use the allow‑list sites.



{: .note}
> In a real tenant, admins enable **SharePoint Restricted Search Scope (RSS)** so Copilot can use **only the non-risky sites we identified**. This temporarily limits **both Copilot and SharePoint search** to that allow list **for all users**, letting us run a safe pilot while we test.  
> You won’t run PowerShell in this simulation. In the real environment you’d need to run these steps to install the PowerShell module first: [Get started with the SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).
