   > This section highlights the process of quickly unblocking a Copilot pilot with a limited number of users. Use this process only for small pilots where the customer refuses to proceed due to data oversharing and sensitive data leak concerns. This process will disable regular SharePoint search for most sites for all users. Have a defined plan for when the pilot will end and search will be re-enabled.

   > In a real environment you would use the top 100 sites.
