# Exercise 02: Enable controlled access for Copilot sites

### Introduction
Because the company is security-first, this exercise uses a staged pilot to limit blast radius. You’ll scope Copilot to a small, known good set of SharePoint sites and block access elsewhere. This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive R&D and partner data — the key blocker keeping Copilot in an “AI disabled” state — and unblocks a safe, controlled pilot.
