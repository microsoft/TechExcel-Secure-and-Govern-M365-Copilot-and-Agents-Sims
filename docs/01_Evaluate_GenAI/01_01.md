## Task 01: Review existing sensitivity labels and default recommendations


### Description
In this task, you’ll establish a baseline of your current sensitivity label design — what exists, where it applies, and what’s missing — so you can decide the minimal, effective label set for a safe Copilot pilot.

### Success criteria
1. You captured a concise summary of the current labels and gaps (e.g., color, scope, encryption, content marking, Teams protection, auto‑labeling).

### Key steps

#### 01: Open Purview and review labels
1. [] Go to **https://purview.microsoft.com**.

1. [] In the left navigation menu, select **Solutions**, then **Information Protection**, and then **Sensitivity labels**.

   {: .highlight }
   > As a rule of thumb, a simple taxonomy (e.g., up to ~5 parent × 5 sublabels) prevents confusion. Save this for a later discussion; don’t derail into taxonomy debates now.

1. [] Select the dropdoen arrow next to **Confidential** then check **All Employees** and select **Edit label**.

   {: .highlight }
   > Note the color (visual cue) here. If there are no colors, consider advising the customer to adopt consistent colors (e.g., orange for Confidential).

1. [] Select **Next** on the **Scope** step: review the applicable locations (Files, Emails, Meetings).

1. [] Select **Next** on the next steps under **Items**. Review the information on the these steps: **Control access (encryption)**, **Content marking**, **Protect Teams meetings and chats** and then select **Next** on each. 

   {: .note }
   > If encryption and markings are off, plan a later conversation on access control and user cues. If Teams protection is off, consider a Teams Premium discussion with stakeholders.

1. [] Select **Next** through **Auto‑labeling**, **Groups & sites**.

1. [] Select **Cancel** when reaching the **Finish** step.
