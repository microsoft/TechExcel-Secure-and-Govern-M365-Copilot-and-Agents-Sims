> - Activity: was the label applied, changed, or removed?
> - How it was applied details: If applied, was this done manually by a user, via auto-labeling, via a document library, default or something else?
> - The file name, including a View source link to see the contents of the file
> - Sensitivity label: which label was involved in the activity?
> - Sensitive info type: If the label was auto-applied based on a SIT, which exact SIT, policy, and policy rule triggered the labeling?
> - Location details: For example, the link to the SharePoint site and file path, Exchange subject and sender/reciever
