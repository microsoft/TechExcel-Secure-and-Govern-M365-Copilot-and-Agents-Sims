## Task 02: Assess label coverage and mapping to Copilot‑relevant content


### Description
In this task you’ll identify where sensitive data actually lives and whether it’s labeled, producing a concrete map of protected vs. unprotected content to define Copilot scope and immediate remediation priorities.

### Success criteria
1. You can show where high‑value content resides and whether it’s labeled.
1. You captured examples and paths for follow‑up protection work.

### Key steps

1. [] Navigate to **Explorers**.

1. [] Select **Data explorer**.

1. [] In the **Data explorer** search bar, type **Proseware** and select the **Proseware** custom SIT. 

   {: .note }
   > Review distribution across SharePoint, OneDrive, Exchange, Teams, and Microsoft 365 Copilot.

1. [] Select **SharePoint**.

1. [] Select the **Leadership** site.

1. [] Open the first flagged document.

1. [] Select the **Details** tab to see SIT matches and confidence.

1. [] Go to **Activity Explorer** and from the filters top menu, select the dropdown arrow for **Selected filter set: None**. 

1. [] Apply the preset **Sensitivity labels applied, changed, or removed** to review adoption patterns and details (Who applied them and how, file links, triggering SIT/policy).

1. [] Select the checkbox on the first row, to open the activity.

   > Here you can view additional details for this activity. There are some fields that could be useful for learning more about how sensitivity labels are used in the organization:
   > - Activity: was the label applied, changed, or removed?
   > - Details on how it was applied, and if applied, was this done manually by a user, via auto-labeling, via a document library, default, or something else?
   > - The file name, including a View source link to see the contents of the file.
   > - Sensitivity label: which label was involved in the activity?
   > - Sensitive info type: if the label was auto-applied based on a SIT, which exact SIT, policy, and policy rule triggered the labeling?
   > - Location details: for example, the link to the SharePoint site and file path, Exchange subject and sender/receiver.
