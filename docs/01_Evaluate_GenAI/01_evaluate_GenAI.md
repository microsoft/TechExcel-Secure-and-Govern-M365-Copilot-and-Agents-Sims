# Exercise 01: Evaluate Gen‑AI usage and analyze existing labels

## Introduction
Contoso Research wants to accelerate R&D with Copilot and agents without repeating past leaks or widening access to crown-jewel IP. This exercise baselines what sensitive data exists and how it’s labeled today, so any AI rollout starts from a defensible classification scheme rather than guesswork. It addresses the CISO’s concern about Teams/365 chatter leaking details and the leadership team’s demand for tight control before enabling AI broadly.
