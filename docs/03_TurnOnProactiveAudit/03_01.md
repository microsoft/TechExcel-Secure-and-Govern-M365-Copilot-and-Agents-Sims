## Task 01: Enable Audit (if not enabled)

1. [] From the left side menu, select **Solutions**, then **DSPM for AI** and then **Overview**.
   
    {: .note }
    > Now you’ll focus on discovering potential risks that could affect Copilot and agents. You’ll do this by **enabling Audit** (if not already enabled) and creating the **recommended policies** in **DSPM for AI** related to Copilot and Agent use, and enabling **DLP** and **IRM** analytics. Then you’ll look at some high-level reports that begin to provide risk insights.

1. [] Select the **Getting started** step and then **turn on Audit**.
   
    {: .note }
    > If auditing isn’t turned on for your organization, the first step under **Getting started** asking you to enable **Audit** will be unchecked.
    > It might take up to **60 minutes** for the change to take effect.
