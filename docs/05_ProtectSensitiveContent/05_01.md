{: .note }
> In your real tenant, use Microsoft Graph and Security & Compliance PowerShell to enable and sync **container labels** for sites, then apply them at scale. Refer to Microsoft Learn for step‑by‑step commands (Install **Microsoft.Graph** modules, `Connect-MgGraph`, fetch/update directory setting `EnableMIPLabels`, `Connect-IPPSSession`, and run `Execute-AzureAdLabelSync`).
