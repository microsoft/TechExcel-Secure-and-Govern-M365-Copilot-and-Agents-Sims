## Task 01: View DSPM for AI default data risk assessment

1. [] From the left side menu, select **Solutions**, then **DSPM for AI** and then **Data risk assessments**.

1. [] Under **Default assessment**, select **View details**.

1. [] Under **Sensitivity labels on data**, review the graph (aggregated across the scoped sites).

    {: .note }
    > 
    >For Copilot and agents we are mostly concerned with **Not labeled + Sensitive information Types (SITs) Detected**, because this is **unprotected sensitive content**.  
    > Under **Items shared with**, you can review the numbers to explain the data:  
    > - **Anyone** — open links that anyone can access without authentication. Best practice is to **disable** this option unless there is a specific reason to use it.  
    > - **People in your organization** — links available to any authenticated user in your org. A user must click the link at least once to have standing access (and therefore Copilot access).  
    > - **Specific people** — links shared to named users/groups (internal or external).  
    > - **People outside your organization** — items shared with external identities.

1. [] Scroll down to **Data risk assessment results** (the SharePoint sites list). Review each column:
    {: .note } 
    > - **Total items** — number of files in the site.  
    > - **Total items accessed** — number of items accessed.  
    > - **Times users accessed items** — total number of access events (one file can be accessed many times).  
    > - **Unique users accessing items** — count of distinct users who accessed any item.  
    > - **Total sensitive items** — files with sensitive data.  
    > - **Total scanned items** — items scanned for sensitive data.  
    > - **Total unscanned data** — items not yet scanned for sensitive data.  
    > - **Items shared with** — sharing link types in the site (see definitions in the previous note).

1. [] Select **Export**.

1. [] Choose **CSV** and select **Export**.

1. [] Close the **Export data risk assessment results** blade window.

1. [] Select the site URL for **/sites/salesandmarketing** to open its details.

1. [] In the **Overview** tab, you’ll have the same graph previously viewed, but now it’s scoped to the single site selected.

1. [] Select the **Identify** tab to initiate or review on-demand classification for at-rest content.
   
    {: .note }
    > On-demand classification manually scans existing content so long-dormant files get evaluated (critical for Copilot readiness).

1. [] Select the **Protect** tab to review mitigation options.
   
    {: .note }
    > To reduce oversharing risk, you can **Limit Microsoft 365 Copilot access to this site** by selecting:  
    >   – **Restrict access by label** (block processing of content with a specific **sensitivity label** using **DLP for Copilot**).  
    >   – **Restrict all items** (use **SharePoint Advanced Management (SAM) – Restricted Content Discovery (RCD)**).

1. [] Select **Restrict all items**.

1. [] Select the **Sales and Marketing** site.

1. [] In the site’s **Settings** tab, scroll to **Restrict content from Microsoft 365 Copilot** and switch to **On**.
   
1. [] Select **Save**.

1. [] In the browser window, select the Purview **Default assessments** tab.

    {: .note }
    > Other label-driven protections to consider:  
    > - **Default sensitivity label** for a SharePoint document library.  
    > - **Default labels** to label all new items by default.  
    > - **Sensitive information auto-labeling policy** (select **View items** to review matched files).  
    > - **SharePoint site sensitivity label** (container label).  
    > - **Review unused files** with **Data Lifecycle Management (DLM)** retention policy to reduce exposure.

1. [] Select the **Monitor** tab on the site result window, to **Run a site access review**.
   
    {: .note }
    > The view shows counts of sites: **Shared with anyone**, **Shared organization-wide**, **Shared with specific people**, **Shared externally**.  
    > You can then start a **SharePoint site access review** from the SharePoint Admin Portal or run an access review in **Microsoft Entra** to make sure access granted is up to date.
