## Task 01: View DSPM for AI default data risk assessment

1. [] From the left side manu, select **Solutions**  then **DSPM for AI** and then **Data Assessments**.

1. [] Under **Default assessment**, select **View details**.

1. [] Under **Sensitivity labels on data**, review the graph (aggregated across the scoped sites).

    {: .note }
    > For Copilot and Agents we are mostly concerned with **not labeled + sensitive information types (SITs) detected**, because this is **unprotected sensitive content**.  
    > Under **Items shared with**, explain the link types:  
    > - **Anyone** — open links that anyone can access without authentication. Best practice is to **disable** this option unless there is a specific reason to use it.  
    > - **People in your organization** — links available to any authenticated user in your org. A user must click the link at least once to have standing access (and therefore Copilot access).  
    > - **Specific people** — links shared to named users/groups (internal or external).  
    > - **People outside your organization** — items shared with external identities.

1. [] Scroll down to **Data risk assessment results** (the SharePoint sites list). Review each column:
   
    {: .note }
    > - **Total items** — number of files in the site.  
    > - **Total items accessed** — number of items accessed.  
    > - **Times users accessed items** — total number of access events (one file can be accessed many times).  
    > - **Unique users accessing items** — count of distinct users who accessed any item.  
    > - **Total sensitive items** — files with sensitive data.  
    > - **Total scanned items** — items scanned for sensitive data.  
    > - **Total unscanned data** — items not yet scanned for sensitive data.  
     > - **Items shared with** — sharing link types in the site (see definitions above).

1. [] Select **Export**.

1. [] Choose **CSV** and select **Export**.

1. [] Select the site URL for **/sites/SalesandMarketing** to open its details.

1. [] On **Overview**, explain this view mirrors the earlier graph but scoped to the single site.

1. [] Select **Identify** to initiate or review on-demand classification for at-rest content.
   
    {: .note }
    > On-demand classification manually scans existing content so long-dormant files get evaluated (critical for Copilot-readiness).

1. [] Select **Protect** to review mitigation options.
   
    {: .note }
    > Ways to reduce oversharing risk include:  
    >- **Limit Microsoft 365 Copilot access to this site**  
    >- **Restrict access by label** (block processing of content with a specific **sensitivity label** using **DLP for Copilot**).  
    >- **Restrict all items** (use **SharePoint Advanced Management (SAM) – Restricted Content Discovery (RCD)**).

1. [] Pretend to select **Restricted Content Discovery** and open the SharePoint Admin Center link (Sales and Marketing site settings).

1. [] In the site’s settings, scroll to **Restrict content from Microsoft 365 Copilot** and switch to **On**.
   
    {: .note }
    > Other label-driven protections to consider:  
    > - **Default sensitivity label** for a SharePoint document library.  
    > - **Default labels** to label all new items by default.  
    > - **Sensitive information auto-labeling policy** (click **View items** to review matched files).  
    > - **SharePoint site sensitivity label** (container label).  
    > - **Review unused files** with **Data Lifecycle Management (DLM)** retention to reduce exposure.

1. [] Select **Monitor** to **Run a site access review**.
   
   {: .note }
   > The view shows counts of sites: **Shared with anyone**, **Shared organization-wide**, **Shared with specific people**, **Shared externally**.  
   > You can run a **SharePoint site access review** (SAM) and/or a **Microsoft Entra access review** to ensure access is up to date.
