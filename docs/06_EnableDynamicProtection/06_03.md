## Task 03: Enable Adaptive Protection with conditional access

1. [] In the left navigation menu, select **Adaptive Protection**, then **Adaptive Protection settings**. 

    {: .note }
    > If a user utilizes Microsoft 365 Copilot to quickly find, access, and then download sensitive data causing them to be classified as high risk as we reviewed earlier, you may want to automatically restrict their access to SharePoint sites with a `Confidential` or `Highly Confidential` site sensitivity label to prevent futher harm until the behavior can be investigated. This approach still allows them to access low risk SharePoint sites such as the IT department so the user can get help if they were restricted in error. Let’s set this up. 
   
1. [] Set Adaptive Protection to **On** if it is not already. 

1. [] In the left navigation menu of Adaptive Protection, select **Insider risk levels**. 

1. [] Under **Insider risk policy**, select the dropdown. 

1. [] Check the box next to **DSPM for AI - Detect Risky AI usage**. 

1. [] On the **Conditions for insider risk levels** section, under **Elevated risk level**, select the drop down and choose **High severity alert generated for user**. 

    {: .note }
    > For the next part, you’ll go over the recommended settings for a demo environment, to ensure that Adaptive Protection triggers easily. 
   
1. [] Under **Past activity detection** and **Insider risk level timefram**, make sure both fields are set to **30 days**. 

1. [] **Insider risk level expiration**: leave box checked and select **Save**. 

1. [] In the left navigation menu for Adaptive Protection, select **Conditional Access**. 

1. [] Select **Create policy**. 

    {: .note }
    > This will take you to the Microsoft Entra admin center for the next steps However, to create the conditional access policy we want, we first need to create an authentication context 

1. [] In the left navigation menu, under **Entra ID**, select **Conditional Access**. 

1. [] In the new left menu for Conditional Access, select **Authentication contexts**. 

1. [] Select **New authentication context**. 

1. [] Type a **name**: 

    ```
    Purview Adaptive Protection - Elevated Risk
    ```

1. [] Type a **description**: 

    ```
    Block access to sensitive SharePoint sites
    ```
   
   Then select **Save**.

1. [] In the left menu for Conditional Access, select **Policies** and then select **New policy**. 

1. [] For name, type:

    ```
    Block elevated risk users from accessing sensitive SharePoint sites
    ``` 
   
1. [] Under **Assignments** - **Users**, select **0 users and groups selected**. 

1. [] Under **Include**, check **All users**. 

1. [] Select the **Exclude** tab, then select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts. 
In this case, you’ll add 

    ```
    admin@SCIPCP97065916.onmicrosoft.com
    ``` 

1. [] Check **Robin Kline’s** admin account, and then select **Select**.

1. [] Select **Create**. 

1. [] Go back to the **Adaptive Protection** browser tab, then in the **Conditional access** tab, refresh the policy list to show the new policy is there. 

1. [] In the left menu, go to **Solutions**, then **Information Protection**, and then **Sensitivity labels**.
